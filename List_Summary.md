- [Balancing Artificial And Real Intelligence In The Finance Industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/09/28/balancing-artificial-and-real-intelligence-in-the-finance-industry/): AI has already proven beneficial in the finance industry, but it must work alongside human intelligence to reach its full potential. This combination is crucial for higher-level issues and the relational aspect of finance. The future of the industry will require financial education, emotional intelligence, and skills in software engineering, data science, and machine learning. Investing in the human workforce will also be a larger part of budgeting.

- [Exploring the data storage of tomorrow: Supramolecular memristors based on bistable [2]catenanes](https://phys.org/news/2023-09-exploring-storage-tomorrow-supramolecular-memristors.html): Researchers have developed a new type of memristor, called supramolecular memristors, that could be used for high-density data storage in artificial intelligence and big data applications. This technology, known as resistive random-access memory (RRAM), offers improved energy efficiency and stores data through changes in resistance. The memristors, made from a system of interlocked molecular rings, can switch between high and low resistance states quickly and have non-volatile storage capabilities. This advancement shows promise for molecular memory devices.

Customer support agents using AI tools saw a 14% increase in productivity, especially for less experienced agents. AI can also analyze past interactions and detect the caller's mood to provide better support. However, challenges include the belief that AI suggestions are inferior to human agents, conflicting orders on when to follow AI or use human judgment, and language models' tendency to make up falsehoods. It is crucial to set up AI properly and address data security. The future impact of AI on customer service jobs is uncertain, but it can lead to job decline and improved service. The decision to prioritize improving customer service or minimizing costs with AI implementation is crucial.
