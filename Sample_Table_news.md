      <td>Hollywood actors are set to resume negotiations with studios and streaming services after the end of the writers strike. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Radio and Television Artists (SAG-AFTRA) will begin strike negotiations on Monday, with several studio executives present. Late-night hosts and shows like Bill Maher, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver have announced their return to work. The writers strike has had a significant impact on late-night TV viewership, with declines of 40% to 50%. However, negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and studios have resulted in a deal being reached in just five days. The writers union has approved a three-year contract agreement with studios, gaining wins in compensation, employment length, staff size, and control of artificial intelligence. Companies cannot require writers to use AI, but it can be used if agreed upon.</td>

      <td>Former Apple design chief Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are reportedly collaborating on a project to create an "iPhone of artificial intelligence." The goal is to develop a device that combines the sleek design of the iPhone with advanced AI capabilities. This venture, potentially backed by a $1 billion investment from Softbank, aims to revolutionize the AI industry, similar to how the iPhone transformed the mobile industry. The partnership is exciting due to Ive's successful career at Apple and the potential impact on how we interact with AI technology.</td>

      <td>The article highlights the importance of balancing artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence in the finance industry. While AI has many useful applications, it is limited in its ability to handle complex decision-making and understand nuanced situations. The optimal intelligence system in finance requires a combination of AI for basic tasks and human intelligence for higher-level issues and the relational aspect of finance. This collaboration will require changes in financial education and investment in the human workforce.</td>
